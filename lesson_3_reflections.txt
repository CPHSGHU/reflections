When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Collaborating with people in editing the same repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because other people might modify anything.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks exist only on GitHub. They are clones of other users' projects, which enables the tracking of contributors to a project, while still making the user using the fork treat the project as their own.
Clones are simple copies of a repository. Clones are useful to edit an instance of a remote repository locally, or duplicating local projects.
Branches are a part of repositories. Branches can be used to edit logical units of code which eventually need to be merged together or killed.
